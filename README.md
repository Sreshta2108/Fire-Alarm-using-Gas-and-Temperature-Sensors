# Fire-Alarm-using-Gas-and-Temperature-Sensors
This project implements a simple but effective fire detection and alarm system using MQ-2 Gas Sensor and LM35 Temperature Sensor, integrated with an Arduino UNO. When dangerous levels of gas or temperature are detected, the system triggers an alarm (buzzer or LED) to alert nearby users.
